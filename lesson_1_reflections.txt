How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Diff shows me the lines that were added and those that were deleted in the file by showing a plus/minus symbol along margin.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
In case of manually choosing when to commit, you can decide when the changes you have made all 
serve a single logical purpose. This way all of your commits will compile and it would also make sense to roll back to any
one of them since an entire feature (or set of features) would get rolled back. In case of automatic saving, like in Google
Docs, the pro is that versions get saved even in case you forgot to "commit" at that point. This is useful when you are preparing
documents etc. In case of code, your code may not compile if the version is saved while you were in the middle of typing a line.
As such going back to a version wouldn't make any logical sense and you have a lot of versions cluttered up without knowing, for eg,
which one you should roll back to in order to remove just one feature you added recently.
